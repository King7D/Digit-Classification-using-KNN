## Overview
This project applies the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes data preparation, model tuning via 5-fold cross-validation, and evaluation of the final model on a test set. The outcomes are visualized to showcase the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.

## Features
Data Preparation: Combines image and label data for training and testing.
Model Tuning: Utilizes cross-validation to determine the optimal number of neighbors.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
Visualization: Displays cross-validation results and samples of correctly classified digits.
